From UCPOP [which they got from Prodigy].  Note: there is no operator 
to get back down from a box...

(operator 
 GOTO
 (params (<x>) (<y>))
 (preconds (on-floor) (at monkey <y>))
 (effect (del at monkey <y>) (at monkey <x>)))

(operator
 CLIMB
 (params (<x>))
 (preconds (at box <x>) (at monkey <x>))
 (effects (onbox <x>) (del on-floor)))

(operator
 PUSH-BOX
 (params (<x>) (<y>))
 (preconds (at box <y>) (at monkey <y>) (on-floor))
 (effects (at monkey <x>) (at box <x>) (del at monkey <y>) (del at box <y>)))

(operator
 GET-KNIFE
 (params (<y>))
 (preconds (at knife <y>) (at monkey <y>))
 (effects (hasknife) (del at knife <y>)))

(operator
 GRAB-BANANAS
 (params (<y>))
 (preconds (hasknife) (at bananas <y>) (onbox <y>))
 (effects (hasbananas)))

(operator 
 PICKGLASS
 (params (<y>))
 (preconds (at glass <y>) (at monkey <y>))

(operator

 (params (<y>))
 (preconds (hasglass) (at waterfountain <y>) (at monkey <y>)  (onbox <y>))
 (effects (haswater)))
